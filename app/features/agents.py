"""
Conversational multi-agent assessment — server-side core.

Ports the agent registry, eight-stage methodology, directive parsing and
orchestration routing from the uploaded BRO agent UI into tested backend logic.
The chat surface (app/web.py) and API (app/bro_app.py) sit on top of this.

Design: deterministic and offline by default. When a provider key is present,
agent turns can route through the live Claude adapter; without one, a
deterministic stand-in produces structured, methodology-faithful turns so the
whole flow is demonstrable and testable with no external calls.
